Isaac Batsa is a student of gimpa sot studying computer science With popular courses like Data Structures, Electronic Circuit Numerical Methods.

About Us: 
The Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) was established in 1961 as a joint Ghana Government /United Nations (UN) special fund project. Originally named the Institute of Public Administration, it was set up as one of the key strategic institutions to develop the public administrative system, to provide civil servants with administrative and professional competence, and to plan and administer national, regional and local services.

Overview 
In 1966, the joint sponsorship ended and the UN formally handed over the Institute to the Government of Ghana. In 1969, the Institute was then re-designated as the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration to reflect its expanded functions. For more than 50 years, GIMPA’s activities have been guided by five successive mandates, beginning with the first legislative instrument of 1961 to the current GIMPA Act, 2004 (Act 676).
Each mandate affirmed the status of the Institute as the national management development institute to provide for the study of public administration and management of Ghana. By its latest mandate, GIMPA now offers courses in its areas of competence leading to the award of certificates, diplomas and degrees up to the doctoral level. 
The areas of competence are defined to include training and education in leadership, management, public administration and technology. Today, GIMPA has transformed itself into the leading management development institute and is an independent public tertiary institution with financial and operational autonomy.
GIMPA’s mission is to maintain a Centre of Excellence for training in public and business administration, by continuously enhancing the capability of middle and top-level executives in public and private sectors as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) both in Ghana and internationally, to manage their institutions and enterprises efficiently and effectively. The Institute is accredited by the National Accreditation Board.

Question:  What is the deputy rector’s name?

Question:  Who is the dean of School of Public Service and Governance (SPSG)
Dr. Patrick Tandoh-Offin
Dean, School of Public Service and Governance
I welcome you to the website of the School of Public Service and Governance (SPSG), one of the key academic sectors at GIMPA. The school was given its current name in August 2013 following the merger of the former GIMPA Public Services School (GPSS) and the School of Governance and Leadership (SGL), which were both established in 2005 to provide graduate training in Public Sector Management and Development.
The School of Public Service and Governance (SPSG) offers a setting that fosters the growth of a variety of gifts and talents, making it an interesting place to be. Our undergraduate and Postgraduate programs in governance, public, and development management enable our students to become leaders with the moral complexity and intellectual rigor required to tackle the challenges of an important period of social transition in our developmental states.
Public leaders today are faced with a wide range of challenges, from the local to the global, that frequently call into question the authority of institutions and the function of individuals in resolving public issues. Recent governance failures highlight the need for a fresh perspective on public policy that recognizes both the opportunity for educated and involved citizens as well as the constraints of the state.



Who is the head of Public Management & International Relations
Dr Gina Teddy
Head, Department of Public Management and International Relations
You are warmly welcome to the Department of Public Management and International Relations portal. We are pleased that you could take the time to visit our page. Ours is one of the leading departments of the Institute, hosting some of the oldest and original programmes of the Institute. We have produced, perhaps the biggest number of alumni in the history of the Institute ranging from the Certificate to the doctoral level.
The public is a significant part of our nation-building efforts as a country and over the years, we have strived to be the place of choice for officials from the various sectors who are desirous of acquiring relevant knowledge and skills for effective public sector management or engagements.
In addition, given the growing global interdependency and integration, there cannot be any exaggeration of the increasing role and relevance of international relations and diplomacy as a key area of both academic enquiry and hands-on professional training.
It is in that vein that our master’s in international relations and diplomacy has become one of the most attractive and popular offerings across the Institute. We will continue to develop more innovative and market-driven programmes at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels and we entreat you to keep visiting this space from time to time as we update you on some of the exciting new programmes in the offing. Thank you most sincerely and do have a wonderful time!

We encourage students in this Department to be critical and self-reflexive. We expect you to read critically, to write thoughtfully, and we want you to be a real challenge even to the faculty. We perceive you as prospective practitioners who will bring their own views and expertise to bear.
Shortly, you will realize that you have entered a very lively, challenging, diverse, and warm community.

About the Department
The GIMPA Business School used to operate as a single large school. As the School grew in programme offerings and student numbers, coordinating areas were created to ensure effective and efficient operation. These included Management Science, Business Management; and Accounting and Finance coordinating areas. Further growth engendered full departmentalisation. The Department of Management Science was, thus, established in 2021.
The Department is a leader in education and research in the areas of Project Management and Supply Chain Management. With customer satisfaction as a critical focus of businesses, we ensure our students have a good appreciation of the entire value chain of businesses with particular focus on the key aspects of organisations and operations that deliver value to customers.
A project is one of the ways of doing things and has recently become a modus operandi for realising organisational goals. The Department, thus, seeks to improve the performances of firms by training and equipping our students with the state-of-the-art skills, knowledge and experience in Project Management. We do this by employing effective pedagogical approaches such as case studies, simulations, role plays and experiential learning.
On the research front, we utilise diverse research methods encompassing theoretical models and empirical analysis of field data. By way of research, our department’s faculty are exploring and expanding the frontiers of knowledge in Project and Supply Chain Management disciplines.
